This is a simple package to check if a lat, lon point is inside a shapefile.

Usage:
is_point_in_shape_file(shapefilePath,lat,lon,whether or not to also return a graph, sets point size of graph)

To install:
devtools::install_github("jgoman99/is-lat-lon-in-shapefile/isLatLonInShapeFile")

Notes:
The graphs don't look great right now. I will fix that (Probably).
